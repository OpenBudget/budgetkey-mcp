# OpenBudget MCP Server

An MCP server that provides access to the OpenBudget API, allowing you to query and search various budget-related datasets.

## Description

This project provides a FastMCP server that interfaces with Israel's OpenBudget data.</br>
Allowing easy access to budget data, contracts, and supports information.</br>
It serves as a bridge between the OpenBudget API and MCP clients.

This project is possible only thanks to amazing work of [OpenBudget/BudgetKey](https://github.com/OpenBudget/BudgetKey) team.</br>

## Features

- Full access to Israel's governmental budget data
- Real-time integration with the OpenBudget API
- Comprehensive search capabilities across multiple data categories
- Historical budget tracking and analysis
- Contract and support payment information retrieval
- Easy-to-use MCP interface for client applications

## Requirements

- Python 3.10 or higher
- [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) package manager

## Installation

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd OpenBudget-mcp
uv venv
.venv\Scripts\activate
uv pip install -r pyproject.toml
uv lock
```

## Usage

Install and run the server using one of these methods:

1. For use with [Visual Studio Code (using Copilot)](https://code.visualstudio.com/download):</br>
Go to [vscode/mcp.json](/.vscode/mcp.json) and replace {YOUR-LOCAL-PATH} with the path you cloned the repo.</br>
VSCode should discover you server automatically.</br>
If that doesn't work, make sure you enabled MCP & MCP.Discovery in [vscode://settings/mcp](vscode://settings/mcp).</br>
Make sure to enable agent mode in your vscode copilot.</br>
